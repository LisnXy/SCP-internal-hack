# Readme
The GUI is mainly based on **imGui** which hooks the DirectX functions. 

And thanks to **Il2cpp** and **dnspy** which immensely make my work more convinient.

This program is mainly based on the params about the equipment.

**This project is for interest so I WON'T UPDATE.

## Usage
Just use any injector to inject the dll file **at the beginning of the game**, which can easily avoid the anti-cheat thread the game creates.

Enjoy it.
